"Customer Segmentation with K-Means Clustering: Unlocking Insights from Mall Customer Data"
This repository contains a Python script and Jupyter Notebook for performing customer segmentation using the K-Means clustering algorithm on mall customer data. The objective of this project is to identify distinct customer segments within the mall's customer base based on their behavior and characteristics, enabling the mall to tailor its marketing and services to different customer groups effectively.

Introduction

Understanding customer behavior and preferences is crucial for businesses, including malls and retail stores. Customer segmentation helps in categorizing customers into different groups with similar traits, which allows businesses to create targeted marketing strategies, optimize inventory, and enhance the overall customer experience. K-Means clustering is a powerful unsupervised machine learning technique that can be applied to segment customers based on their attributes.
Dependencies

To run the code in this repository, you'll need the following Python libraries:

    NumPy
    pandas
    scikit-learn
    Matplotlib
    Seaborn (optional, for enhanced visualization)
    Jupyter Notebook (optional, for running the provided notebook)

You can install these dependencies using pip:

bash

pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn jupyter

Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

    Clone this repository to your local machine:

    bash

git clone https://github.com/gpradeepkumar98/K-means-clustering-

Navigate to the project directory:

bash

    cd kmeans-clustering-mall-customer-data

    Open the Jupyter Notebook (K_Means_Clustering_(with_Norm_and_DB).ipynb) in your preferred environment or editor.

Usage

In the Jupyter Notebook, you will find step-by-step instructions on how to perform customer segmentation using K-Means clustering on the mall customer data. The notebook includes code snippets and explanations to guide you through each part of the process. You can run the code cells interactively in the notebook.

To run the provided Python script instead of the notebook, you can execute the following command in your terminal:

bash

python kmeans_customer_segmentation.py

This will generate customer segments and provide insights into the characteristics and behavior of each customer group.
Results

After running the code in the notebook or the Python script, you will obtain results that include:

    Customer segments identified through K-Means clustering.
    Visualizations to illustrate the characteristics and behavior of each customer segment.

These results can help the mall tailor its marketing efforts, optimize inventory, and improve the overall customer experience. By understanding the unique preferences and needs of different customer segments, the mall can make data-driven decisions to enhance customer satisfaction and boost revenue.
